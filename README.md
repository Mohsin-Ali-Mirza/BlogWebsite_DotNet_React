# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Run Vite by npm run dev
Run Backend using Visual Studio 2022
Make Sure to npm i to install dependencies and install tailwind css(vite version)
Also the backend has some files missing which includes the password and username to the database, therefore you wont be able to use the database.
